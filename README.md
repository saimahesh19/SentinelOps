# 🚀 AI-Driven Observability & Anomaly Detection Pipeline

### 🧠 Real-time Observability Stack with Kafka, VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry, and AI-based Anomaly Detection


---

## 🌐 Overview

This project implements a **modern observability stack** combined with **AI-based anomaly detection** for logs and metrics.

It leverages:
- **Kafka** for real-time log streaming  
- **Telegraf, OpenTelemetry & VictoriaMetrics** for metrics ingestion  
- **Grafana & Loki** for visualization and log management  
- **Machine Learning models (Prophet, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)** for trend and anomaly detection
